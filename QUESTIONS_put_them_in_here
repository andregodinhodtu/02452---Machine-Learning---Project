1º reg_part_B_NN file - Basline model 

    it´s about the baseline model. Should we use the method model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=True) or just calculate y_train_mean = y_train_inner.mean(). From what i have been looking correct answer is latter

        "As a baseline model, we will apply a linear regression model with no features, i.e. it computes the mean of y on the training data, and use this value to predict y on the test data."

    Check this with TA´s

2º How should we decide which hyperparameters to choose

3º When to use one hout of k encoding? What methods and what problems may arise from this? In linear regression should we?

4º should we always work with standertized data? It says that for regression we need to do it but what about the others

5º What should we do with the best model for a certain inner fold. Use the mean of the best predictions, becuase we used it to feature selection nt model selection

6º So regarding the cross validation pipeline in which we need to use the logistic regression controlling parameter. I don´t understand how should we do it. should we have a list of the parameters and randomly use one in that list. Should we cross validate and choose them int the inner folder? not getting it 

7º Logistic regression is always linear?

8º When performing the regression task, should we take out classification variable death event?

9º About Naive Bayes: The assignment suggests a formula using the term b. I think that suggest using the function BernoulliNB as the classifier. From what I have understood this is good for binary features but not for continuous ones. Could we use GaussianNB as the classifier or should we apply some type of binarization or turning them discrete to the features, or should we abandon the possibility of using NAive Bayes?
